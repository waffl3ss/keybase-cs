# keybase-cs
Keybase Webhook notifications for CobaltStrike

Original idea from @Und3rf10w (https://github.com/Und3rf10w/Aggressor-scripts/tree/master/Pushover)

Create a webhook in the keybase chat of your choice, once you have the URL, add it to the empty variable in "keybase-cs.sh".

Put the keybase-cs.sh into "/opt/cobaltstrike/" and make it executable (chmod +x). If you want to add it somewhere else, change the location in "cs-keybase-notifier.cna". Load the agressor script into CobaltStrike and you're ready to go!
